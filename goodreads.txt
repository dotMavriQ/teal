It is not a to This book showcases very eloquently put thoughts on the meaning of life and how to face it, it could be considered a bible of Stoicism. It is not a tough read for the most part either even though Marcus references thinkers and known people of the ages but the notes are really complimentary in this regard. This is one of the best books I have ever gotten my hands on, it really spoke to me and I think it could do the same for any man my age as well as any woman. Some people might find it troublesome that passages almost repeat the very same sentiments that have already been put forward numerous times in the book to which I would say: That is the entire point, it is gnostically treating the practise of Stoicism. I love you Marcus Aurelius, thank you. ...more",

Om du känner en intresserad amatörkock som verkligen snöat in sig på hamburgare så kanske den är en rolig liten gåva... men i övrigt rätt så menlös.Jag har nog på min höjd testat på 5 hamburgare från boken i min livstid och 2 var väl smakkombinationer jag kommit att återbesöka...vilket inte är särskilt kaxigt om man jämför med den mängd recept jag provat från internet eller dagstidningar genom åren. ...more",

It's... evocative, erotic, orally fixated, intensely blunt and youthful poetry of a(n african) womans life experiences... rich in nuance, strong in expression... sometimes artfully executed, other times desperately blunt on purpose. There's vivid descriptions of war and the wrongdoings of men..so be warned.I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did... If you're into contemporary poetry then you might enjoy it. ...more",
